## Description

This project is a Solana-based betting application that allows users to place bets on the team they believe will win a cricket match. If the user's chosen team wins, they receive their bet amount plus a profit. Bets placed on the losing team are distributed among the winners, and those who bet on the losing team do not receive any returns.
